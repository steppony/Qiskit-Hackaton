## Learn how to teleport and debunk myths about quantum computing on the way

- We use a kahoot quiz that consists of common myths and buzzwords and is funny. 
- The kahoot quiz is used between the short theory units to recatch the students attention
- we indicate where in the lecture the questions are posed like this: *question x - y*

### Introduction

Duration: 5 Minutes

Form of Teaching: Presentation by Teacher Including Kahoot 

Content:
- *Question 1*

- Show Teleportation circuit [INSERT TELEPORTATION CIRCUIT]
- The Teleportation circuit is used to show the students where the lecture is headed to. The teacher promises to teach them a little bit about real teleportation

### Qubits & Superposition 

Duration: 10 Minutes

Form of Teaching: Teaching 

Content:
- Kahoot *questions 2 - 4* 
- Explain what a qubit is in distinction to classical bit
- show the concept of superposition with the 2d simulation "Bloch circle"


### Gates and measurements 

Duration: 10 Minutes

Form of Teaching: Open Discussion

- Explain X, H, Z gate using the excercise provided *Excercise 1*


### Putting it all together - Quantum teleportation


Duration: 10 Minutes

Form of Teaching: Teacher explains qiskit code


Content: 
- Kahoot *questions 4-6*
- Step by step walk through the code to implement the quantum teleportation algorithm and show the results - quantum teleportation actually works



### Testing Exercise

At the end you should also link to at least one testing exercise, which help the students test if they understood the material. 
The solution for this exercise can be in the same file as the other solution if you want.

This will be not part of the exercise, but is thought for the students to test their knowledge.
