# Learn how to teleport and debunk myths about quantum computing on the way

##Abstract
This lecture is designed to introduce Gate based quantum computing in an intuitive manner to high school students with a mayor in physics. No preknowledge in quantum mechanics is needed.
On our path from superficial buzz words to the main goal, comprehending the quantum teleportation channel we will debunk quantum myths, get to know fun facts and learn about the basic gates.
We hope to create an awareness about the true power of quantum computation.
The skills and knowledge aquired in this lecture will help students interested in quantum technologies to further engage the quantum computing community and allow them to follow advanced lectures regarding this topic.
This lecture aims to provide as much information about quantum computing as possible using minmial mathematical and physical concepts. We therefore e.g. neglect the normalization and phase of the wavefunction to make this lecture more
tangible to high school students.

- We use a kahoot quiz that consists of common myths and buzzwords and is funny. 
- The kahoot quiz is used between the short theory units to recatch the students attention
- we indicate where in the lecture the questions are posed like this: *question x - y*

### Introduction

Duration: 5 Minutes

Form of Teaching: Presentation by Teacher Including Kahoot 

Content:
- *Question 1*

- Show Teleportation circuit [INSERT TELEPORTATION CIRCUIT]
- The Teleportation circuit is used to show the students where the lecture is headed to. The teacher promises to teach them a little bit about real teleportation

### Qubits & Superposition 

Duration: 10 Minutes

Form of Teaching: Teaching 

Content:
- Kahoot *questions 2 - 4* 
- Explain what a qubit is in distinction to classical bit
- show the concept of superposition with the 2d simulation "Bloch circle"


### Gates and measurements 

Duration: 10 Minutes

Form of Teaching: Open Discussion

- Explain X, H, Z gate using the excercise provided *Excercise 1*


### Putting it all together - Quantum teleportation


Duration: 10 Minutes

Form of Teaching: Teacher explains qiskit code


Content: 
- Kahoot *questions 4-6*
- Step by step walk through the code to implement the quantum teleportation algorithm and show the results - quantum teleportation actually works



### Testing Exercise

At the end you should also link to at least one testing exercise, which help the students test if they understood the material. 
The solution for this exercise can be in the same file as the other solution if you want.

This will be not part of the exercise, but is thought for the students to test their knowledge.
